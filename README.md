Post Travel bills and expense report filling in an organization an be time-comsuming and chaotic. First you need to keep track of all the bills, gather them and then you need to manuaaly enter each and every value in PeopleSoft (or any other software that you company uses). 

It takes about : 18 hours (to collect and find all the bills), 10 hours (analyzing the values), , 3 hours (filling the values), 13 hours (editing and enhancing the written recods)
This sums up to 44 hours i.e 4 - 5 working days. 

Hence we have automated this process for the ease of an organization. Now all you need to do is:
Login to the web app, upload all the bills, click on process, download the zip file and voila!!!
